## About The Project

![ESC Banner](README/Banner.png)

This project started with my naivety and ignorance. In an effort to avoid buying an ESC for my RC plane, I went down a rabbit hole learning how to build one and ultimately discovered why just buying one would have saved me a lot of time (lol).

While trying to understand how a BLDC ESC works, I found many existing projects either too confusing or too advanced for my skill level. That’s why I decided to build my own barebones ESC as a clear, beginner-friendly learning project to figure out how this stuff actually works.

### Bill of Materials

Most of this stuff I bought from Aliexpress (cause im broke)

* Arduino Nano 3.0
* 3x IR2104
* 6x IRLU7843
* 3x 2.2uF Tantalum capacitor
* 3x 10uF Electrolytic Capacitor
* 3x 1N4148 Diode
* 6x 33k Resistor
* 3x 10k Resistor
* 6x 100R Resistor
* 22 AWG Solidcore Wire
* Perfboard
* Headers
* Screw Terminals

### Tools I used

* Multimeter (Ferrex, ALDI)
* Soldering Iron (FNIRSI HS-02)
* Oscilloscope (Rigol DHO804)
* Power Supply (Korad KA3005DS)
